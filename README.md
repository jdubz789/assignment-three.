The brand is 'Egypt noir', a range of timeless fragrances that capture the beauty of the egyptian night, inspired by the legends of ancient egypt, transporting wearers to the heart of Egypt.

The brand guidelines include:

## Customer Persona

### Definition

I created one customer persona to apply to my app. Here's "Layla Khalid" and some of the elements about her:

- Name - Layla Khalid

## Design Principles Used
I opted for minimalist typography to emphasize the floating images, maintaining a green and gold color scheme throughout to reflect Egyptian nights. The fragrance bottles are inspired by Egyptian legends, accompanied by a simple pyramid logo. All content is centered with a subtle amount of white space surrounding it for balance. Finally added some soft sounding classical music to match the theme.

## Other requirements achieved
login/get the app buttons & floating images included for user interactivity.

## Things I struggled with assignment-three

i would have liked to add a sliding effect where each image slides left to reveal context about that specific range upon clicking the navigation links.

i would have also liked to optimise for all screen sizes.

overall, i feel it was an improvement on the last project.
